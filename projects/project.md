# Final Project

## Instructions

Use one of the datasets in the `/data` directory on your VMs.

Some recommended datasets are:
 * `nycflights13`
 * `sf-crime`
 * `dga`
 * `prosper-loan`
 * `walmart-triptype`


You will be using one or more of the following technologies we did in class:

 * Hive
 * Pig
 * Spark

You goal will be the following:

 * Examine the Data
 * Clean and deal with any missing / invalid data
 * Do some analytical queries to show some interesting aggregations on your data
 * Generate a few "insights" on your data, supported if possible by tables or visualization


Example Insights:

 * "Flights from New York to Chicago are 60% more likely to be delayed in the Spring months than in Fall"
 * "Domains from Russia or China are 25%  more likely to be fraudulent than those in the com subdomain."


You will present your findings in a document (Github markdown) is fine, as well as provide all scripts or notebooks that you used, as well
as output


Recommended Output:

 * `README.md`: Document
 * `scripts/`: Code
 * `output/`: Output
